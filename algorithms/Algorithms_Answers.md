## Analysis of Algorithms

### I

- a) O(n^3)
- b) O(log n)
- c) O(log n)
- d) O(n)
- e) O(n^4)
- f) O(n)
- g) O(n)

### II

- a) 

`def: get_max_difference(a):
    max = -1;

    for i in a:
        if 
        ???? what are we solving for ???`

- b)
    def: find_floor(n):
        n_bottom: n/2
        n_top: n - n/2
        def: drop_egg(n):
            if n ==

Divide the floors in two parts. Throw an egg, and if the egg breaks in any case, move down by current position/2, else move up by relative part - current position / 2, until f is found.

### III

- a) O(n) because the items will always be greater than the pivot, therefore the less list will be empty
- b) O(n^2) because the sub lists will have to rearrange themselves until each list only has one element in it
